// Requirements:
// Your program must be able to use a positive integer sequence as argument.
// Your program must use the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort the positive integer sequence.
// The algorithm must be the Ford-Johnson algorithm.

// TODO: Have a PmergeMe class that can be instantiated
// with a input vector or deque of integers.
// The class should have a run method that will sort the input
// the run method should return a sorted vector or deque of integers.
// The main should time the runs for vector and deque.
